## Description
* You can now have more pistols or rifles than only one!
* Seperate Ammunition with each weapon

**IMPORTANT**
* This is only tested with ESX 1.6.0, 1.7.5, 1.9.3 and above
* With ESX 1.10.2 the default resmon is 0.01 ms. With this changes, the resmon will increase to 0.03ms.
* You can't have 2 Pistols, that doesn't work! But you can have 1 Pistol and 1 Combatpistol with different Ammunation.

**Nice to know**
With this Snippet, I fixed LegacyFuel *(Petrolcan Issue)* for ESX!
